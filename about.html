                    Welcome to WordsCount! Our company is dedicated to analyzing language and offering services that allow you to measure and smartly search or change documents. The WordsCount company is indebted to notable linguists Dr. Harry McLaughlin, Dr. Robert Harris, Mr. William H. DuBay, and the late Dr. George Klare for their contributions to our tools. Also, many users have made suggestions that I adopted. It is a blast to see an email from a user who has figured out something I didn't and was good enough to share it with the rest of us - very rewarding. Years ago, I tried to identify aspects of written language that could be improved with computer programs. I wanted to help writers by applying Natural Language Processing, and the overlapping field of Computational Linguistics, to the most important needs of language workers including teachers, students, professional writers, and language enthusiasts. The WordsCount service is evolving with contributions from language specialists and folks who care about communicating well. I am supporting the burgeoning plain language movement, and trying to offer features that serve those who care about using language effectively.                </div>

        <h3>What does WordsCount do?</h3>

<p>The WordsCount service is a free service created by Alain Trottier to help language workers, and anyone looking for a better way to communicate. I have seen users analyze radio screenplays, college papers, professional emails, speeches and more. You are invited to try it here. It analyzes your document and calculates many things that would be difficult to do manually such as how many articles and conjuctions you wrote, the SMOG reading level and the count of every letter used and graphs showing you the most difficult sections.</p>

<h3>How accurate is it?</h3>

<p>Not accurate enough. That is why I continue to review and revise algorithms and techniques trying to improve accuracy and performance. While I will never be satisfied, I hope you'll appreciate how much progress has been made. For example, the syllable counter is probably the most accurate online tool available. Most of the counts on the statistics page are exact. Sentence counting is notoriously difficult so I am sweating that one. If you find an inaccuracy, please let me know so I can figure out how to get better.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

<p>This service is currently free. Since it costs to develop, support, host and maintain, WordsCount reserves the right to charge fees in the future.</p>

<h3>Can I help?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. You can provide samples of text that you have manually counted, things like syllables, words, and especially sentences. We also like to hear your ideas. The most valuable contributions are algorithms. You do not need to be a programmer. You need only figure out the steps like a recipe to accomplish a specific task. For example, tell us why do you like one document and not another? You might figure out an algorithm such as: 1] long sentences + 2] lots of coordinating conjunctions (and, but) = 3] gets me lost. This is enough to get me started. Here is another example: 1] count all words = A, 2] count all numbers = B, 3] calculate math density = B / A, 4] categorize: over 1% = a scientific paper, over 5% = math paper. If you know pseudo code or software language like Java - those snippets are great, but the preceding two recipes seem simple, but many small steps accumulate into significant upgrades. Another way is to provide list of words such as politics, music or exercise. What words are most representative of a topic? Just send the algorithm or list with a brief description through the contact page. Also, you can submit a text that tricked WordsCount into providing incorrect information. Perhaps an odd sentence threw the sentence counter off. Please, send me that sentence and the wrong result.</p>

    	<h2 class="head1 w1">Release history</h2>
        <ul class="list1">
        	<li><p class="link1">July 2009: v4.0</p><br>Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Trottier switch from a pure algorithm approach for deriving the grade level of a text to a dictionary procedure. This change makes two important improvements. The syllable counter accuracy jumps above 95%. The other result is tagging difficulty at the word level instead of sentence or paragraph. Mr. Trottier also rebuilt the service on the latest Java technology which improved user experienced performance, code management and reliability. The user interface was simplified and the front end was upgraded to XHTML/CSS standards.</li>
        	<li><p class="link1">June 2007: v3.0</p><br>Working with Dr. G. Harry McLaughlin, WordsCount undergoes a major change where Dr. McLaughlin's highly regarded readability formula SMOG is rebuilt and validated. Also, Dr. McLaughlin and Mr. Trottier start working on a new readability formula.</li>
        	<li><p class="link1">April 2005: v2.0</p><br>With input from many helpful folk Mr. Trottier updated the look and feel and rebuilt the parser, the component that would become the most important.</li>
        	<li><p class="link1">Spring 2001: v1.0</p><br>With the assistance of Dr. Robert Harris, WordsCount became useful and accurate. Dr. Harris was instrumental in focusing the service on something useful. His contribution will always be greatly appreciated.</li>
        	<li><p class="link1">June 1995: Beta</p><br>Alain Trottier built his first language tool. It was ugly, but helped flesh out a few ideas.
